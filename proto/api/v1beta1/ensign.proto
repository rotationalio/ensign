// The Ensign service is meant to allow publishers (producers) and subscribers
// (consumers) of events to interact with the Ensign eventing system; e.g. this is a
// user-oriented API that is the basis of the user SDKs that we will build. There are
// two primary interactions that the user client may have: publishing or subscribing to
// topics to send and receive events or managing topics that are available.
service Ensign {
    // Both the Publish and Subscribe RPCs are bidirectional streaming to allow for acks
    // and nacks of events to be sent between Ensign and the client. The Publish stream
    // is opened and the client sends events and receives acks/nacks -- when the client
    // closes the publish stream, the server sends back information about the current
    // state of the topic. When the Subscribe stream is opened, the client must send an
    // open stream message with the subscription info before receiving events. Once it
    // receives events it must send back acks/nacks up the stream so that Ensign
    // advances the topic offset for the rest of the clients in the group.
