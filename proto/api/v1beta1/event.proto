// Event is a high level wrapper for a datagram that is totally ordered by the Ensign
// event-driven framework. Events are simply blobs of data and associated metadata that
// can be published by a producer, inserted into a log, and consumed by a subscriber.
// The mimetype of the event allows subscribers to deserialize the data into a specific
// format such as JSON or protocol buffers. The type acts as a key for heterogeneous
// topics and can also be used to lookup schema information for data validation.
// TODO: do we need to allow for event keys or is the type sufficient?
// TODO: how should we implement the event IDs, should we use a time based mechanism like ksuid?
// TODO: is this too nested? should we flatten some of the inner types?
// TODO: do we need generic metadata?
// TODO: what about offset and epoch information?
