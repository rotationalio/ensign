[{"id":0,"href":"/system/configuration/","title":"Configuration","section":"System","content":" Configuration # Ensign services are primarily configured using environment variables and will respect dotenv files in the current working directory. The canonical reference of the configuration for an Ensign service is the config package of that service (described below). This documentation enumerates the most important configuration variables, their default values, and any hints or warnings about how to use them.\nRequired Configuration\nIf a configuration parameter does not have a default value that means it is required and must be specified by the user! If the configuration parameter does have a default value then that environment variable does not have to be set. Ensign # The Ensign node is a replica of the Ensign eventing system. Its environment variables are all prefixed with the ENSIGN_ tag. The primary configuration is as follows:\nEnvVar Type Default Description ENSIGN_MAINTENANCE bool false Sets the node to maintenance mode, which will respond to requests with Unavailable except for status requests. ENSIGN_LOG_LEVEL string info The verbosity of logging, one of trace, debug, info, warn, error, fatal, or panic. ENSIGN_CONSOLE_LOG bool false If true will print human readable logs instead of JSON logs for machine consumption. ENSIGN_BIND_ADDR string :5356 The address and port the Ensign service will listen on. Sentry # Ensign uses Sentry to assist with error monitoring and performance tracing. Configure Ensign to use Sentry as follows:\nEnvVar Type Default Description ENSIGN_SENTRY_DSN string The DSN for the Sentry project. If not set then Sentry is considered disabled. ENSIGN_SENTRY_SERVER_NAME string Optional - a server name to tag Sentry events with. ENSIGN_SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT string The environment to report (e.g. development, staging, production). Required if Sentry is enabled. ENSIGN_SENTRY_RELEASE string {{version}} Specify the release of Ensign for Sentry tracking. By default this will be the package version. ENSIGN_SENTRY_TRACK_PERFORMANCE bool false Enable performance tracing to Sentry with the specified sample rate. ENSIGN_SENTRY_SAMPLE_RATE float64 0.2 The percentage of transactions to trace (0.0 to 1.0). ENSIGN_SENTRY_DEBUG bool false Set Sentry to debug mode for testing. Sentry is considered enabled if a DSN is configured. Performance tracing is only enabled if Sentry is enabled and track performance is set to true. If Sentry is enabled, an environment is required, otherwise the configuration will be invalid.\nGenerally speaking, Ensign should enable Sentry for panic reports but should not enable performance tracing as this slows down the server too much.\nMonitoring # Ensign uses Prometheus for metrics and observability. The Prometheus metrics server is configured as follows:\nEnvVar Type Default Description ENSIGN_MONITORING_ENABLED bool true If true, the Prometheus metrics server is served. ENSIGN_MONITORING_BIND_ADDR string :1205 The address and port the metrics server will listen on. ENSIGN_MONITORING_NODE_ID string Optional - a server name to tag metrics with. Tenant # The Tenant API powers the user front-end for tenant management and configuration. Its environment variables are all prefixed with the TENANT_ tag. The primary configuration is as follows:\nEnvVar Type Default Description TENANT_MAINTENANCE bool false Sets the server to maintenance mode, which will respond to requests with Unavailable except for status requests. TENANT_BIND_ADDR string :8080 The address and port the Tenant service will listen on. TENANT_MODE string release Sets the Gin mode, one of debug, release, or test. TENANT_LOG_LEVEL string info The verbosity of logging, one of trace, debug, info, warn, error, fatal, or panic. TENANT_CONSOLE_LOG bool false If true will print human readable logs instead of JSON logs for machine consumption. TENANT_ALLOW_ORIGINS string http://localhost:3000 A comma separated list of allowed origins for CORS. Set to \u0026ldquo;*\u0026rdquo; to allow all origins. SendGrid # Tenant uses SendGrid to assist with email notifications. Configure Tenant to use SendGrid as follows:\nEnvVar Type Default Description TENANT_SENDGRID_API_KEY string API Key to authenticate to SendGrid with. TENANT_SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL string ensign@rotational.io The email address in the \u0026ldquo;from\u0026rdquo; field of emails being sent to users. TENANT_SENDGRID_ADMIN_EMAIL string admins@rotational.io The email address to send admin emails to from the server. TENANT_SENDGRID_ENSIGN_LIST_ID string A contact list to add users to if they sign up for notifications. SendGrid is considered enabled if the SendGrid API Key is set. The from and admin email addresses are required if SendGrid is enabled.\nIf the Ensign List ID is configured then Tenant will add the contact requesting private beta access to that list, otherwise it will simply add the contact to \u0026ldquo;all contacts\u0026rdquo;.\nSentry # Tenant uses Sentry to assist with error monitoring and performance tracing. Configure Tenant to use Sentry as follows:\nEnvVar Type Default Description TENANT_SENTRY_DSN string The DSN for the Sentry project. If not set then Sentry is considered disabled. TENANT_SENTRY_SERVER_NAME string Optional - a server name to tag Sentry events with. TENANT_SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT string The environment to report (e.g. development, staging, production). Required if Sentry is enabled. TENANT_SENTRY_RELEASE string {{version}} Specify the release of Ensign for Sentry tracking. By default this will be the package version. TENANT_SENTRY_TRACK_PERFORMANCE bool false Enable performance tracing to Sentry with the specified sample rate. TENANT_SENTRY_SAMPLE_RATE float64 0.2 The percentage of transactions to trace (0.0 to 1.0). TENANT_SENTRY_DEBUG bool false Set Sentry to debug mode for testing. Sentry is considered enabled if a DSN is configured. Performance tracing is only enabled if Sentry is enabled and track performance is set to true. If Sentry is enabled, an environment is required, otherwise the configuration will be invalid.\nQuarterdeck # The Quarterdeck API handles authentication and authorization as well as API keys and billing management for the Ensign managed service. Its environment variables are all prefixed with the QUARTERDECK_ tag. The primary configuration is as follows:\nEnvVar Type Default Description QUARTERDECK_MAINTENANCE bool false Sets the server to maintenance mode, which will respond to requests with Unavailable except for status requests. QUARTERDECK_BIND_ADDR string :8088 The address and port the Quarterdeck service will listen on. QUARTERDECK_MODE string release Sets the Gin mode, one of debug, release, or test. QUARTERDECK_LOG_LEVEL string info The verbosity of logging, one of trace, debug, info, warn, error, fatal, or panic. QUARTERDECK_CONSOLE_LOG bool false If true will print human readable logs instead of JSON logs for machine consumption. QUARTERDECK_ALLOW_ORIGINS string http://localhost:3000 A comma separated list of allowed origins for CORS. Set to \u0026ldquo;*\u0026rdquo; to allow all origins. Sentry # Quarterdeck uses Sentry to assist with error monitoring and performance tracing. Configure Quarterdeck to use Sentry as follows:\nEnvVar Type Default Description QUARTERDECK_SENTRY_DSN string The DSN for the Sentry project. If not set then Sentry is considered disabled. QUARTERDECK_SENTRY_SERVER_NAME string Optional - a server name to tag Sentry events with. QUARTERDECK_SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT string The environment to report (e.g. development, staging, production). Required if Sentry is enabled. QUARTERDECK_SENTRY_RELEASE string {{version}} Specify the release of Ensign for Sentry tracking. By default this will be the package version. QUARTERDECK_SENTRY_TRACK_PERFORMANCE bool false Enable performance tracing to Sentry with the specified sample rate. QUARTERDECK_SENTRY_SAMPLE_RATE float64 0.2 The percentage of transactions to trace (0.0 to 1.0). QUARTERDECK_SENTRY_DEBUG bool false Set Sentry to debug mode for testing. Sentry is considered enabled if a DSN is configured. Performance tracing is only enabled if Sentry is enabled and track performance is set to true. If Sentry is enabled, an environment is required, otherwise the configuration will be invalid.\nDevelopment # Keep up to Date!\nIt is essential that we keep this configuration documentation up to date. The devops team uses it to ensure its services are configured correctly. Any time a configuration is changed ensure this documentation is also updated! TODO: this section will discuss envconfig, how to interpret environment variables from the configuration struct, how to test configuration, and how to add and change configuration variables. This section should also discuss dotenv files, docker compose, and all of the places where configuration can be influenced (e.g. GitHub actions for React builds).\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/eventing/","title":"Eventing","section":"Ensign Documentation","content":" Eventing # A quick primary on event-driven microservice architectures!\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/sdk/","title":"SDKs","section":"Ensign Documentation","content":" SDKs # This is the primary section for Ensign users.\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/system/","title":"System","section":"Ensign Documentation","content":" System # This section of the documentation describes the Ensign system.\n"}]
