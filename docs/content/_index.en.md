Ensign is a new eventing tool that makes it fast, convenient, and fun to create  event-driven microservices without needing a big team of devOps or platform engineers.

Ensign is an eventing system distributed in time and space. It stores chronological changes to all objects, which you can query with SQL to get change vectors in addition to static snapshots.

This is Ensign's developer documentation; we're glad you're here!
