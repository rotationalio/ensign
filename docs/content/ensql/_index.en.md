Ensign implements a lightweight structured query language called EnSQL that should be familiar to users of relational databases. The twist for Ensign is that EnSQL allows users to query an Ensign topic over specific windows of time to capture and filter events. While the base langauge will be familiar and easy to pick up if you've used ANSI or Postgres SQL in the past, there are a few differences and gotchas that are described in detail in this documentation!
