What's the best way to name your topics? This is an **excellent** question!

Remember, a topic is just like a table in a traditional relational database, so it can be helpful to think about that as you name them.

Each team may have slightly different naming conventions, and the most important thing when it comes to naming is that your teammates understand the names! That said, our favorite technique is to give each data source and type needs its own topic, for instance:

`user-logins-plaintext`
`product-reviews-xml`
`weather-reports-json`
`model-results-pickle`
